## Deployment

- This app is self-hosted at https://patients.fundezer.org on a Debian server, not on Lovable's
  hosting. A push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds
  on the server and restarts the `fundezer-patient` service. Leave that workflow in place.
- The production build MUST use `NITRO_PRESET=node-server`. The default nitro
  target here is a Cloudflare Worker bundle, which cannot run under Node.
  Lovable's own sandbox ignores that variable, so its builds are unaffected.
- The server runs Node 24. `@supabase/supabase-js` does not work on Node 20 — it
  emits only a deprecation warning and then fails at request time with HTTP 500.
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are needed at runtime as well as
  at build time; the service reads them from `.env` via systemd.
